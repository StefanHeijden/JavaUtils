      hippostd:content: <p>Diplomats from Sweden, Germany, The Netherlands
        and the EU Delegation have been trying in vain to be admitted to
        the public hearing against former HDP co-chair Figen Yüksekdağ in
        Sincan. In clear breach of Turkish law and the Vienna Convention
        on Diplomatic Relations, foreign diplomats are once again denied
        access to a public hearing. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs
        and the Ministry of Justice have been made aware of the situation,
        but refused to act on the matter. This situation is unacceptable
        and bodes ill for the current state of the rule of law in this country.</p>
